WHICH IS BEST TO USE
SYSTEM FUNCTION OR SUBPROCSS MODULE 
TO RUN THE PYTHON COMMAND

1.To verify if command is successful or not:- 
  ->After running any python command, if it is successful, developer sends an exit code which is in form 0 or 1...any other number.
  ->0 means code is successful
  ->any other number means command failed

2.To verify output of any cmd:-
  ->In linux cmd prompt, the exit code is stored in a variable called '?'
  ->variable name: ?
  ->cmd: echo $?               (dollar symbol is used to identify any variable like '?')

3.Diff b/w system() func and subprocess module:-
  ->system() func does not return the cmd output, it prints it, but subprocess returns and also gives you the control.
    Means: system() func gives 2 outputs, one the cmd output that they internally print using print() func. So, you can't store this data in a variable.
    NOTE-print() func doesn't give you any control, not even you can store the data. You can only print.
    subprocess module does not print the output, infact they return you the output, which means either-
        a)you can store the output in a variable
        b)in future you can print this variable

  ->a)system() func shows the output along with the exit code
    b)subprocess shows only output, and if you want exit code then, run cmd
      subprocess.getstatusoutput("date")

Hence, prefer to use subprocess.getstatusoutput() as this gives the exit code also along with cmd output & they return the output so that we can store it for any future use.
  

4.Diff b/w tuple and list:
  ->tuples value can't be changed
    lists are changeable means mutable.
